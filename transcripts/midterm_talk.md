You guys are all really luck that your'e going to go thourgh these one one one reviews with Krystal and Cam. When I was a student we didn't have them. As someone how has say in on midterm reviews for other cohorts.  If you're not aware where you stand, this review will help you gain that awareness and give you more to focus on to reach your goals.

What did happen is halfway through the course, some other staff members came in besides the instrutor, we had an open forum.  You're six weeks into thi, it's half over.  The next weeks are going to go really fast.  This is the half way point there's just as much tie ahead as behind me.

Tha's true, and at a certain point what the staff had to say was true.

Looking back, things did pick up, in a way in terms of way you perceive that amount of time.  As we go, the projects ecome more complicated and there become more things ot consider as you start looking too outcomes and your job search and being prepared and getting a portfolio together and all these little things that stack up into this lbig thing.  Come into play more.

Another thing that came up that was preally mimporatn for my cohort was that, and maybe Ro can talk about this, something that was a trend in my class, for the first six weeks most of us as students wer ehitting the requirements on Canvas. and past that I checked th box so I'm going to get a passing grade on that. And generally we would, but there comes apoint if your'e spending hte time and money to be here, every assignmetn you work on is an opportunity to gorew in all the different areas you've been learning so far. perfection is illusive, but ou should always strive to be as excellent asyou an be to the way it works to how it looks. 

When I heard that I was like oh shoot, i really need to work on my styling. I would always leave that till the end. Because I wanted something that works. Didn't want to press a pig.  REally importnat to develop tose skills and present your work in the best posisble light. 

I felt shakey about my javasript and my CSS.  Clicked for me in those areas if I'm not feeling strong about those, I've just identified the areas that I need tow work on. THere's the school of thought I just need to play to my strengths. 

I knew for me, I'm going to be better off and stronger overall if I can identify the places i"m having trouble and really dig in there.

I don't know how cam will outline the requirements for you and your final projects. 

Any time We got an assignment, that was going to be the focus.  For final project I made a mostly front end project with javascript and CSS because I nnkew I needed to spend the most attention there. 

So, that was something that happened in my cohort and when we got that message from the person who was grading our work, you guys need to teap it up in terms of the effort we were putting in and people took note of that. ANd it became celar in retrospet, we weren't sure how much extra effort was necessary.  Every bit of effort is necessary and to your benefit. 

May as well go for it while you're here in a safe space.

I want to leave it to Ro to point out to you guys to point out the genreal trends.

Ro:

Something I noticed with the coding challenges only a few of you guys start doing it now because when you have interviews a lot of the interviews are going to be whiteboard challenges.  The more compfortable you are it will help you in the long run and you'll be more comfortable in front of a whiteboard or another developer and be able to approach...


With what sam was saying, styling for some of you.  Some more comfortable others last mintue. Want more things to put on your portfolio.  Easier to fix minor changes that totally revamping.

Sam: Two salient points.

When months go by can be hard to go back.  Don't let things go by where you will want to go back to.  Help stay involved in hat project if it could go on your portfolio.  Code challenges, trust me, when I was a student we did them every friday eveyr week for the first six weeks. then every day for the second six weeks. It was probably, I didn't pass one until the 4th week and then I didnt' pass one until a couple weeks later.  It sucked, it hurt me.  It hurt my ego and my ability to feel good about myself. The other thing it did is it made me painfully aware of the things I need to work on and the concepts I need to sderstand better. And that was the same thing and why I pushed myself to look at the ugly truth of the matter. I'm not good at this thing. What about this don't I understand. 

Really trying to break it down. Strip the emotions out of it. If I try to do something and fail at at, the way I failed that's one more thing taht I know isn't a solution, one step closer to the actual solution. If I know I failed at something then I know the next thing I need to work on.  the one thing I can say is that the only true measurement of failure in this sort of industry is not trying at all.  The first technical interview I every had, for one I  didn't know what I was walking tinto.  Ithought I was geting cofffee, then the conversation went a certain way and he brought out a pen and a napkin and he brought out a pen and a napkin.  And he was like how would you do this.  He asked me a question I had seen on a coding challenge before. I told him the way I would go about doing it.  


Of course it was on a napkin, so syntax wasn't such a focus, more about how you think That's what employers want to know, about problem solving.

Then he was like, what if that's not allowed. I had to admit I didn't know. I know one way to tdo this. One thing that saved me, I don't know but if I would venture a guess, I would try doing this.  He said that's great, that's exactly what you would do.  Really? I wouldn't know technically how to do this. He responded well to that.  

The worst answer you could give is I don't know and I don't know how I would go about it.  

Computer are meant to help us with our human logic.  If you don't knwo wat the details inbetwe, that's okay. You will find the syntax to support that human logic.  someone's probably thought of that algorithm before and fleshed it out. Don't forget to check in with your own instincts to check in with what you know about problem solving in the real world.  So coding challenges guys, really apply yourself, even if it hurts and you fail, it's important to dig into these problem areas that we run into all the time.

Krystal:

From an employer's perspective, it's not really the technical piece if whether you got it right or got it wrong.  They would rather you say I don't know how to do it but this is how I think I would do it.  What you're signalling is resiliance, curiosity, asking questions to get more information, and it's those life skills or soft skills that will get you the job or at least get your further into the interview.  

Think I've said this before, he decided to go with one of our grads not because she had the best skills compared to other aplplicant,s because she showed enthusiasm, wanted to know more, and had good head on her shoulders.  

So by doing coding challenges here, one, you might actually get prestnted with the problem, it's also an opportunity to, tell me about a time about a time you had trouble with a coding challenge. You can walk threm through that process, I tried a different way. 

You're going to fail all the time, break stuff all the time on a job.  So keep that in mind.  Practice hte technical skills but also practice the soft skills.  The whole idea of resilliance.  Oh my god this is so hard.  Maybe it's messy and I'm just going to try to have as mcuch fun a s possible.

One thing that may be Ro can commnent more on.  What Iv'e notice,d I love how you have your group, your talbe, whatever online help tool, also thinking about team work, teamwork is really important. YOur'e not going to be working by yourself, marketing team, business development.  As a developer you will have times you work by yourself.  When you have a problem it shouldn't be I have a problem, teacher help me.  I have a problem boss, help me.  Maybe Ro can maybe have a little blurb about steps you have to do and start practicing here.

Ro:

When you get into rails you'll be getting a lot of errors nad a lot of the erros will be very specific.  If you don't understnad google it.  Other people have probably had the same proble mas you.  Do a bunch of googling before you ask somebody else for help because by you figuring out the solution on your own be able to learn on your own.
