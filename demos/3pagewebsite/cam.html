    Hoboken, NJ &mdash; Cam has been a professional web developer and technology consultant since 2003 having worked for <em>New York University</em>, <em>CAD Sciences</em>, <em>Accela Software</em>, and independently.  Projects of note include the redevelopment of nyu.edu, <em>GreatestGood.org</em>, and an interactive medical education prototype for <em>Columbia University</em>.</p>

    <p>Cam first got involved with computers in the 90s, writing animations with Logowriter for Apple IIe machines back in the days where modems hissed and whirred over phone lines.  He interned over the summers in the computer lab for the Quality Assurance department at the once mighty Prodigy Internet and has been involved with technology throughout his life.</p>

    <p>He earned his bachelors in Information Systems at <em>Carnegie Mellon University</em> and MBA from <em>New York University</em>.  As an instructor for the <em>New York Code + Design Academy</em>, he's working with aspiring web developers over a 12-week bookcamp where they ramp up on modern web technologies and explore new career options.</p>

    <p>Languages he actively uses in web development include:</p>
    <!--* make the following a bulleted list --> 
    <ul>
    	<li>JavaScript</li>
    	<li>HTML/CSS</li>
    	<li>Ruby</li>
  	</ul>

    <p>In his free time, Cam enjoys recreational sports such as volleyball, soccer, tennis, and golf.  Favorite publications are the New Yorker and Harvard Business Review and has a red hot passion for Arsenal Football Club, by far the greatest team the world has ever seen.</p>
