// team/main.js
// We're building an example of a Team with a few different sports Teams
// that inherit from it

// We'll focus on the SoccerTeam...  
// the Team should have
// a name, sport, playerCount, and an array of players called roster
// we should be able to add a player to the roster using an addPlayer method


// the SoccerTeam will have a league and sponsor.
// it will also call the Team constructor, setting the playerCount and sport


// A Player will be another object type with a name, number (shirt number), and status (healthy - true, or injured - false)

// We will have a setHealthy and setInjured status to alter their status.
