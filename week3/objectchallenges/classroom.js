/* 
Create a prototypical Person object. 
From this object, extend a Teacher object and a Student object.
Each of these objects should have attributes and methods pertinent 
to what they describe. Also create a School object that should be 
able to store instances of students and teachers. Make sure to 
write code afterwards that creates instances of these objects to 
make sure that what you've written works well and you're able to 
store the necessary data in each object.
